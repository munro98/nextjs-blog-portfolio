My previous portfolio website was built using Jekyll since Github supported building and hosting the site and had a selection of themes you could pick from. You could also write most of the content of the website in markdown a simplistic mark up language which is much better for writing down documents compared to raw html which jekyll would compile to later.

Nextjs, one of the hotest web frameworks today now allows building static webpages leverging Reactjs so pages render out serverside allowing faster page loads. I thought it make a nice project to revamp my vanilla looking github pages website with a brand new with dark mode, new content and a swanky .xyz domain from the cheapest domain registrar I could find.
